The tool offers visualization and interaction with resulted metrics, easily pinpointing problematic parts of code into a java program.

##Usage
In order to run this program the Eclipse IDE and the RASCAL plugin is required. You can find more information here on how to install the plugin [here](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/start/)
